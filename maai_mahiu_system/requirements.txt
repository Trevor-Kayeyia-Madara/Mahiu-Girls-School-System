# No specific database driver needed for SQLite3 as it's built-in with Python
# Add other dependencies as needed for UI, web framework (if applicable), etc.
# Example for a basic UI (Tkinter is built-in, but others like PyQt/Kivy need install)
# If using a web framework like Flask/Django:
# Flask
# SQLAlchemy # For ORM with SQLite3
